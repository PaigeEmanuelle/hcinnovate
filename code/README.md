This app works by simulating code syntax with blocks that fit together like puzzle pieces.
Blocks are organized by functionality in the block menu, and are named after common coding statements like loops and if statements.

To start working on a project, you can immediately begin adding blocks to the workspace by looking through the block menu
When you find a block you would like to add to you project, drag and drop it into the workspace

To use our customized graphing functionality, first upload a csv file in the upload window. Then combine the generated data blocks to 
the create scatterplot block to make your graph appear in the visual output window. 

For more information on how to graph or manipulate blocks in general, visit our wiki at: https://github.com/PaigeEmanuelle/hcinnovate/wiki
