# Design Documentation
This document outlines the design decisions made during the development of the HCInnovate application, a web application hosted on Github Pages. 


## Initial functional goals: ##

 * Allow novice coders to create coding solutions without having to learn how to program
  
 * Abstract away all sintactical elements to coding
  
 * Give users access to high level algorithms and concepts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence
  
 * Allow users to analyze and manipulate data 
  
 * Allow users to choose their level of abstraction when working on projects
  

## Initial non-fuctional/design goals: ##
  
 * Workflow should mirror user's intuition for how logical statements fit together
  
 * Be useful to novice and expert coders alike
  
 * Users should be able to command several different interfaces at once(ie workspace, visual output and code output)
  
 * Be organized in such a way that users dont have to spend large amounts of time searching for functionalities
  
 * Easy to start working with, no setup or learning required
  
  
## Design process: ##

  **Technologies used:** Blockly by Google, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JS, Plotly
  
  **Experimental Analyses:** Needfinding interviews and survey, prototype user test and interviews, summative user evaluation and design feedback
  
  **Biggest Implementational Challenges**: Merging Blockly functionality with our custom data formats, generating and displaying code from blockly blocks, generating graphs from code in blocks
  
  
## Final functionality: ##
  
 * Users can create programs without having to know any coding language or syntax
  
 * Users can simultaneously view their blocks and the code generated by the blocks in either python or javascript
 
 * Users can run code created with blocks, and have the code interpreted. Text will appear in the console window.
  
 * Users can generate graphs of imported data
 
 * Undo and Redo (in taskbar under Edit) supported. Copy and Paste supported.
 
 
  
  
## Design elements we kept: ##
  
 * All coding elements represented by drag and drop blocks
  
 * Blocks organized by category and color coded
  
 * Four interfaces available at all times: Block workspace, data importing, visual output, and code output
  
 * No setup necesary, just start dragging and dropping blocks
 
  
## Design elements we changed: ##
  
 * Decrease number of windows/combine some functionalities to decrease number of things user has to keep track of
  
 * Added signifiers to steps along the graphing process to prompt user and give visibility for location of data. Users kept missing that data had already been added, and looked a little confused in our user study.
  
 * Organized windows by their sequence in design process (i.e. outputs on right inputs on left)
  
  
## Things we would like to have implemented: ##
  
 * Interaction between imported data and standard blocks. For example, ideally you would be able to do something like add 1 to each y value in the datd you uploaded, then plot the modified data
  
 * Multiple project tabs, ability to save and open projects
 
 * Create variable space for blockly variables to be saved or accessed. Users could see the current value of a variable
 
 * The ability to expand and collapse sections of the screen to increase user control and freedom
 
 * Improve upon and add to documentation, perhaps integrating it into the application instead of having it on a separate screen
