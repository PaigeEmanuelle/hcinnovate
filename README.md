# hcinnovate
Repository for the HCI application of Team HCInnovate (Seth, Russell, and Paige). Consists of a web app that integrates Blockly code. Hosted with Github Pages.


## Initial functional goals: ##

 * Allow novice coders to create coding solutions without having to learn how to program
  
 * Abstract away all sintactical elements to coding
  
 * Give users access to high level algorithms and concepts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence
  
 * Allow users to analyze and manipulate data 
  
 * Allow users to choose their level of abstraction when working on projects
  

## Initial non-fuctional/design goals: ##
  
 * Workflow should mirror user's intuition for how logical statements fit together
  
 * Be useful to novice and expert coders alike
  
 * Users should be able to command several different interfaces at once(ie workspace, visual output and code output)
  
 * Be organized in such a way that users dont have to spend large amounts of time searching for functionalities
  
 * Easy to start working with, no setup or learning required
  
  
## Design process: ##

  **Technologies used:** Blockly by Google, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JS, Plotly
  
  **Experimental Analyses:** Needfinding interviews and survey, prototype user test and interviews, summative user evaluation and design feedback
  
  **Biggest Implementational Challenges**: Merging Blockly functionality with our custom data formats, generating and displaying code from blockly blocks, generating graphs from code in blocks
  
  
## Final functionality: ##
  
  Users can create programs without having to know any coding language or syntax
  
  Users can simultaneously view their blocks and the code generated by the blocks in either python or javascript
  
  Users can generate graphs of imported data
  
  
## Design elements we kept: ##
  
  All coding elements represented by drag and drop blocks
  
  Blocks organized by category and color coded
  
  Four interfaces available at all times: Block workspace, data importing, visual output, and code output
  
  No setup necesary, just start dragging and dropping blocks
  
## Design elements we changed: ##
  
 * Decrease number of windows/combine some functionalities to decrease number of things user has to keep track of
  
 * Added signifiers to steps along the graphing process to prompt user and give visibility for location of data
  
 * Organized windows by their sequence in design process(ie outputs on right inputs on left)
  
## Things we would like to have implemented: ##
  
  Interaction between imported data and standard blocks
  
  Multiple project tabs, ability to save and open projects
