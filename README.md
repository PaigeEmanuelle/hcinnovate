# hcinnovate
Repository for the HCI application of Team HCInnovate (Seth, Russell, and Paige). Consists of a web app that integrates Blockly code. Hosted with Github Pages.


Initial Functional Goals:
  Allow novice coders to create coding solutions without having to learn how to program
  Abstract away all sintactical elements to coding
  Give users access to high level algorithms and concepts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence
  Allow users to analyze and manipulate data 
  Allow users to choose their level of abstraction when working on projects
  

Initial Non-Fuctional/Design Goals:
  Workflow should mirror users intuition for how logical statements fit together
  Be useful to novice and expert coders alike
  Users should be able to command several different interfaces at once(ie workspace, visual output and code output)
  Be organized in such a way that users dont have to spend large amounts of time searching for functionalities
  Easy to start working with, no setup or learning required
  
Design Process:
  Technologies used: Blockly by Google, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JS, Plotly
  Experimental Analyses: Needfinding Interviews and Survey, Prototype User Test and Interviews, Summative User Evaluation and Design      Feedback
  Biggest Implementational Challenges: Merging blockly functionality with our custom data formats, generating and displaying code from blockly blocks, generating graphs from code in blocks
  
Final Functionality:
  Users can create programs without having to know any coding language or syntax
  Users can simultaneously view their blocks and the code generated by the blocks in either python or javascript
  Users can generate graphs of imported data
  
Design Elements We Kept:
  All coding elements represented by drag and drop blocks
  Blocks organized by category and color coded
  Four interfaces available at all times: Block workspace, data importing, visual output, and code output
  No setup necesary, just start dragging and dropping blocks
  
Design Elements We Changed:
  Decrease number of windows/combine some functionalities to decrease number of things user has to keep track of
  Added signifiers to steps along the graphing process to prompt user and give visibility for location of data
  Organized windows by their sequence in design process(ie outputs on right inputs on left)
  
Things we would like to have implemented:
  Interaction between imported data and standard blocks
  Multiple project tabs and save function
