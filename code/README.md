# HCInnovate repository

This folder contains all of the code needed to run our application, including the main HTML and CSS files and the Blockly and Javascript dependencies.

## How to run the application

This project is hosted on GitHub pages. To open our application, simply go to the environment tab on the code section of the repository and 
then click view deployment. 

Or you can simply follow this link: https://paigeemanuelle.github.io/hcinnovate/code/

There is only one page to our application (other than help wikis)

## Getting started

This app works by simulating code syntax with blocks that fit together like puzzle pieces.
Blocks are organized by functionality in the block menu, and are named after common coding statements like loops and if statements.

To start working on a project, you can immediately begin adding blocks to the workspace by looking through the block menu
When you find a block you would like to add to you project, drag and drop it into the workspace

To use our customized graphing functionality, first upload a csv file in the upload window. Then combine the generated data blocks to 
the create scatterplot block to make your graph appear in the visual output window. 

For more information on how to graph or manipulate blocks in general, visit our wiki at: https://github.com/PaigeEmanuelle/hcinnovate/wiki
