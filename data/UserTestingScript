\item ``Hi! Thanks for participating in our user study. Today, we're going to have you complete a task in our new application, HCInnovate, and a similar task in a competing application called Scratch. We'll use the feedback from your performance to improve our app design and experience. Then, we'll ask you to describe each of the applications in a Google Form."

\item ``Each task should take about two minutes, so we'll only need about six minutes of your time in total."

\item ``Let's get started. The purpose of our application is to be an IDE for efficient coding, with an emphasis on data analysis. A main feature of our design is that we can simply drag and drop blocks to generate code and graph data."

\item Explain HCInnovate task: First upload the file ``TestData.csv", and then create a scatterplot of it.  %Add the ``Create New Scatterplot" block to the workspace. Combine the ``data" block with the ``Create New Scatterplot" block to plot the data. Save your work.
Remind them of the task they are trying to accomplish if necessary.

\item ``Do you have any questions about what you're supposed to do?"

\item Answer questions. 

\item User completes HCInnovate task. Remind them of the task they are trying to accomplish if necessary.

\item ``Great, thank you. Now we're going to have you complete a similar task in Scratch."

\item Explain Scratch task: Plot $y=x^2$ by recreating the code blocks shown.

\item ``Do you have any questions about what you're supposed to do?"

\item Answer questions

\item User completes Scratch task

\item ``Thank you! Now we're going to go to a Google Form. First, we will look back at [HCInnovate], and you will indicate whether you think that the given term describes it." ... ``Now, we'll do the same with [Scratch]."...``Now, indicate which words describe both interfaces"
